################# Block to Update ISE VM Details ##############
###############################################################
/*

Valid VM instance types are Standard_D4s_v4, Standard_D8s_v4, Standard_F16s_v2, Standard_F32s_v2, Standard_D16s_v4, Standard_D32s_v4, Standard_D64s_v4 (Size vary from device to device)
Allowed Storage size - (Minimum 300GB and Maximum 32TiB/region/subscription)
Allowed roles are : PrimaryAdmin, SecondaryAdmin, PrimaryMonitoring, SecondaryMonitoring, PrimaryDedicatedMonitoring, SecondaryDedicatedMonitoring, Standalone
Allowed services are : Session, Profiler, TC-NAC, SXP, DeviceAdmin, PassiveIdentity, pxGrid, pxGridCloud

NOTE: For configuration, please make sure to follow the syntax as mentioned and follow below points before updating the variables
    1. Do not pass any services or roles values for primary pan node in virtual_machines_pan variable.
    2. Secondary pan node supports SecondaryAdmin, SecondaryMonitoring and PrimaryMonitoring roles.
    3. PSN node can act as a Mnt (Monitoring) node by assigning any one of these roles - SecondaryMonitoring, SecondaryDedicatedMonitoring, PrimaryMonitoring or PrimaryDedicatedMonitoring
    4. Monitoring role can only be passed once across both the virtual_machines_pan and virtual_machines_psn variable
    5. Service pxGridCloud cannot be added more than once in workload nodes.
    6. Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7) letters from a to z , the digits from 0 to 9 , and the hyphen (âˆ’).
    7. To create only Primary and secondary nodes without any PSN's, virtual_machines_psn variable should be set to {}
